Page Render Steps:

1. Calculate element view sizes (except for elements with align == Align.Fill)

2. Determine section requested sizes

3. Page determines allocated sizes for sections
  -> When a section has its size allocated, it then allocates appropriate size to child sections

4. Elements with Align.Fill use allocated parent section size to determine final size


Rules to enforce:
* Level 1 Section elements (direct children of a Page) cannot have align.CENTER?
* If a Section has alignment == FILL, then its targetSize property is ignored
