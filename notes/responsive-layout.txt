Responsive Layout:

* Properly designed GUIs should be displayed logically and predictably on any reasonably sized viewport
* GUIs should be re-aligned on any screen resize event without significantly altering the layout of an ongoing application
* The only type of application considered is an SPA style

Ideas:
- could have a very easy 'hide' feature which would hide an element and then have the previously occupied space available for bordering controls
- could stick with what we know well and use nested grid for the base of everything
