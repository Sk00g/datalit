Core Library: 2019/04/22
- Responsive layout and alignment system with multiple sections, pages, elements, etc.
- Build rect / icon / label 
- Build core control, page, section 
- Asset Management
- Research and implement main library file structure 
- Build main application loop
- Learn how to make an NPM package


Setup: 2019/04/08
- Gather good resource links on Chrome for javascript, express, node.js, npm, icon resource, js cheat sheet, HTML5 canvas API, color matcher / resources 
- Establish sample apps, inspiration GUIs, write out basic operation, GUI wireframes, etc.
- Prepare IDE for optimal efficiency and backup settings to Drive
- Centralize files, repo, design workflow
- Clarify design tools and organization

Event and Arrangement: 2019/05/04

- Design on overall event strategy, event manager?, registration, event data, bubbling, etc.
- Implement necessary classes to support event infrastructure
- Hook mouse, keyboard, and resize events into system 
- Hook property changed events into system
- Build GUI layer that handles Control-specific event management
- Build state system for dynamicControl.js and have it changed by events automagically
- Redesign most of the alignment / arrangement system to be smarter and more flexible
- Build align.FREE logic for sections
- Build in redraw / rerender logic to redraw and rerender as necessary. Just redraw/rendering the whole shebang for now, optimize later

Styles & Themes: 2019/05/15

- design and build style data objects
- incorporate style data object into codebase
* Taking an urgent detour from style system to address the delayed property update shenanigans
- make styles automatically switch on state change, which occur from events
- design and build theme data object
- incorporate theme data object into codebase
* Need to implement the freaking margin for Section objects... what the heck
- Build the regular button control to test out the advanced theme and style systems to date


--------------------
DIVERTED OR DROPPED
--------------------
- Build 'focus' system handled by page (easier to do after styling stuff is finished)
* Might be worth going back and changing the structure of control constructors to have ALL property registration in the base Control / DynamicControl classes, and just pass the property names in... not sure
* The way Style class receives its property definitions parameter in constructor is somewhat counterintuitive. It is a list of lists where everything else in the library seems to work off regular JS kvp objects for properties. Should probably go in and change this at some point for consistency
