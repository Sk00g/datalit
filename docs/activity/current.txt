IMMEDIATE:
* Get data binding working

2019/10/26 - Currently prototyping the data binding concepts I've been designing for the last few weeks. Working with the most basic possible for every facet: validation, data source, binding declaration in markup, etc. Goal is to scaffold the overall structure and see if it will work. In the middle of figuring out what sort of data paths should be put into markup to declare bindings, and how they will connect up with the data source. May have to write some basic interface structure for data sources...
