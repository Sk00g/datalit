SYSTEM:				Core Library 
(Research -> Design -> Prototype -> Write -> Test -> Document)
STAGE:				Write/Document

IMMEDIATE: 
- Clearly the arrangement and alignment system needs work, so taking a break to fix this
    * Sections and basic elements appear to align properly, including usage of margins. Needs further testing and a code review to make sure things are consistent and making sense. Particularly Align.STRETCH needs testing
    * Taking a break because going straight for too long
    * When coming back:
        1. Make sure existing controls are up to date and working
        2. Clean up all code so far, get rid of anything obsolete
            # Got up to rect alphabetically in controls with this
        3. Update design documents with arrangement strategy writeup while it's fresh
