SYSTEM:				
(Design -> Research -> Prototype -> Write -> Test -> Document)
STAGE:				Write

IMMEDIATE:
- Scrollable Section

* Scroll section is essentially working for vertical scroll only. I'm sure further testing could be done, but core functionality is there and working and appears to be reasonably efficient. Have only been working with a very simple contentSection though, so will start working with a more complicated view within the scroll section, like a account card or profile editor, etc.

- Drop-Down List

COMPLETED
----------

* Ran into arrangement problems, so reworking the system now on a new branch
* Did another side-adventure to optimize a lot of the code and try to debug the stupid memory leak issue
    # Haven't solved the problem, but did optimize a bunch of code, specifically events severly needed a rework...
    # Gone through almost 100% of the code that I could possible imagine is causing the leak. Haven't found it but definitely have things running smoother
