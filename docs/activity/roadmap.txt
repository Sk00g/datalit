TOPICS TO LEARN
------------------------------------
- canvas optimization
- general javascript optimization skills
- how to analyze the in-built mozilla performance tabs and reduce 'layout' calls
- profiling in ES6
- unit-testing in ES6

------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS WHEN APPLICABLE
------------------------------------
- Make custom validations (throw nice errors) for font types, asset names, colors, etc.
- Make a definitive list of properties and an associated compatbility matrix matching controls with their relevant properties for easy lookup
- Improve the asset-loader.py script to do error checking on asset names (no '-' char), and also build in a nesting system to handle directories and such
- Add in custom fonts feature by local file or URL
- For documentation would be great to have a master list of all properties involved in alignment and arrangement so that I (and others) can easily see how to achieve our desired layouts. Otherwise it is confusing with contentDirection, [h|v]align, [h|v]fillTarget, margin, and how those all relate to each other
- For the event system, need to go in and write a ton of error handling stuff
- May need to revisit the mousenter/leave logic to improve the precision. Just not sure if this would be helpful yet
