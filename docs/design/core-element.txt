CORE CONTROL
---------------

* Getters and setters encapsulate internal calculations, private properties, and property change event handling 
* Established clear conventions for consistency across polymorphic constructs
* Elements are unaware and decoupled from their parent structure (Page or Section)


Key Properties (common to all controls):
- debugName: Useful for debugging events and such

- state: Mainly used for automatic style-transitions

- visible: TRUE or FALSE, taken into account by parent Section when drawing (or not drawing if false)

- _arrangedPosition: Unique property, has no external access. The actual derived position to display, absolute position on the canvas

- viewSize: Explicit for most controls, derived in others (label), this size of the actual item. The parent section uses get and set of this property during render (alignment + arrangement). This property should INCLUDE a control's margin in its calculation, and does so by default. Since this property is stored directly, the final display of an item is typically calculated using margin + _arrangedPosition + viewSize
    * Includes get|set viewWidth | viewHeight

- viewingRect: Returns the exact area of the canvas this control is displayed on. Uses _arrangedPosition + viewSize by default. Used for clearing optimization

- hitRect: Returns area considered for hitboxing for mouse events. By default assumes the hitbox starts at _arrangedPosition + margin[0], etc...

- margin: Exactly what it sounds like. Blank space that is considered part of a control's viewing Rect, but not hitRect. It should always be transparent. There is no 'padding', each element has its own margin to fulfill this purpose

- halign|valign: Specifies alignment for this control, values are used by parent structure to perform arrangement and final location calculations. These properties are checked for validity to throw helpful datalit-specific errors

- hfillTarget|vfillTarget: Specifies the percentage of parent to consume when aligning. These values only apply in certain alignment scenarios. When set to -1, this means fill the 'minimum' space possible based on children (only applies to Section and derivatives).

- localPosition: A explicit position within its parent Section (Page or Section). This can be get/set directly, and is only relevant when align = Align.FREE

- zValue: Z-axis value, affects which controls are 'on top' of others. Get/set directly, but only has relevance within immediate tier of controls (ie. applies within it's Parent Section, which has its own zValue relevant to its parent Page)

CONVENTIONS
---------------

* properties wrapped by getter/setter are always be preceded by  '_' (_position)
* enums use CamelCase for the type, and ALL_CAPS for the values
* all other properties use regular camelCase, including methods
* Sections should be displayed in the following order:
    - constructor
    - Override methods (add comment title)
    - Regular methods
    - Override properties (add comment title)
    - Unique Properties getter and setters (add comment region for easy folding)
    - update / draw methods
