PAGE FOCUS
---------------

* Goal is to implement a standard 'focus' system within each Page in a datalit application
* Clicking a focusable item will move focus
* Hitting tab will cycle through focusable items
* Keyboard input will go to the focused item
* If a Section derivative control is focusable, and it has children that are also focusable... error or some sort of layered logic?
    - natural thought would be to go by specificity. The lowest level control (last child) will be focused
* Conflicts of overlapping, unrelated-tree (not children of one another) controls are resolved by zIndex. If not present, they can just be random, this is customer problem dear


- pages must maintain an accurate list of all 'focusable' controls within itself, in order to cycle properly
- this list should be updated when:
    - a focusable control is added to a child of Page
    - a focusable control is removed from a page

* Going to see if we can simplify the focus process by making isFocusable immutable

* Focus should be updated on mouse down, rather than mouseup, for obvious reasons
