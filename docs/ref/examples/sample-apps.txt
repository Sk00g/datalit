1. Codebits
    * Front-end: Simple, swap between search + enter
        # Enter -> Swap mode button, sign in, show topics, main edit section, suggestions
        # Search -> Main search text thing, results beneath, filters above, details beside results
    * Interactivity:
        # Text should have popup badges and suggestions etc.
        # Entering a codebit should generate a popup somewhere when back-end returns
        # Drop-down menus for account / settings
        # Search results need to be a sorted, selectable, list
        # Action options to existing code bits
    * Back-end:
        # Store codebits, account details, settings, do some sorting / searching maybe?
    * Overall UX pattern:
        # Two main pages + accounts + settings, one page at a time 

2. Work Sheet
    * Front-end: Home page should have a few main buttons. Either viewing results + history or managing a current entry
    * Interactivity: Super straight forward actions -> Start/end shift, start/end break, view shifts
    * Back-end: manage settings, record entries, everything else can be derived from entries on the client side 
    * Overall UX pattern:
        # Large trendy 'actions' page to start at. Swaps to single-focus entry manager or shift viewer
        # Shift viewer is classic search / results table / master-slave details
        # Maybe a third page showing results with graphics and analytics (super basic)

3. Parts Inventory
    * Front-end: Everything manageable from a single page
    * Interactivity: 
        # create / edit part details, search / sort parts
        # flag parts that are low, do basic cost analysis
        # CRUD company list
    * Back-end:
        # store orders, companies
    * Overall UX pattern:
        # main area split between details (CRUD for selected) and table results (view / filter / search / sort)
