MAIN LOOP DESIGN
---------------

* Goal is to encapsulate as much as possible in the main loop, to simplify application code
* DO NOT pre-optimize, the only optimization to start with is a flag to redraw from core.GlobalState
* Should separate arrangement from redraw
* Events are already set up as asychronous with callbacks, so this may not need to be part of the main loop

* General loop idea:
    - clear screen
    - draw pageManager -> draw current page
    - current page draws its children (sections and controls)
    - udpate pageManager -> updates current page
    - current page updates its children (sections and controls)
