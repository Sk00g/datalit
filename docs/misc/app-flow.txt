Application Workflow:

* The editor compiles JSON markup superset into actual Javascript code, which is referenced 
by the framework libraries. This is considered a 'build' step, not an actual app run-time step ?

1. index.html, is pulled by the browser, has a single <canvas> element in <body> 
    2. Add a <script type=module src=index.js> tag under <body> element to pull in code
        3. Index.js runs 'init' function, which runs the init logic for CANGUI framework
4. Initialize EventManager, instance is then passed to PageManager
    5. Initialize PageManager which initializes each Page contained therein
        6. Page objects create the actual UI elements, and call render() as required
7. Enter main app loop: 
    clear screen -> update Managers -> draw active page -> requestAnimFrame
